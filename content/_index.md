### Class Policies and Support
- *Class participation*: Attendance is recommended not only for learning the material, but for completing and turning in the in-class exercises. In the event of an absence, it is the student’s responsibility to learn the course material and announcements covered in class. Lectures will not be repeated during office hours. Students are allowed to miss two in-class exercises without their grade in that section being affected. If you must miss a class, please inform the instructor ahead of time by email.
- *Collaboration policy*: Unless otherwise stated, all assignments must be completed alone. Copying from outside sources (e.g., other students, Internet, etc.) on any material to be graded is not permitted and will be considered cheating. Cheating may result in failure of the assignment/exam and/or failure of the class. The University’s policy on Academic Integrity, as stated in the catalog, will be enforced.
- *Due dates and late submission*: Homework assignments and programming projects are due at the beginning of class on the specified day. Late assignments will receive a 25% per day penalty, except in the event of an excused absence. In the event of an excused absence, the late assignment is due at the beginning of the class immediately following the specified due date.
Exams: The final exam will be comprehensive, covering material from the entire course. The final exam will be held during final exam week. The rescheduling of exams must be arranged at least one week in advance. Exams missed without prior permission will be given a grade of zero, except in the event of extreme emergency. In such an event, a makeup must be taken within a week of the missed exam.
- *Grading corrections*: Bring any grading correction requests to the instructor within one week of receiving the grade, or before the end of the semester, whichever comes first. After that, your grade will not be adjusted.
Email policy: If you don’t check your email at your Westmont account, you may forward your mail to your desired email account by setting up a forward file in your login directory. I will only send email to your username@westmont.edu account and I will not be responsible for any delay in your email.
- *Announcement responsibility*: Important announcements, schedule revisions, etc., will be posted on Canvas. You are responsible for information uploaded to Canvas. You are also responsible for any announcements made in class.
- *Cell phones*: You may have cellphones in class, but they must be on mute and not answered until the end of class.
- *Resolving conflicts*: The following chain of command should be followed when attempting to resolve conflicts such as scheduling issues: Contact the instructor first, then the department chair if the issue is not resolved, and finally the dean’s office.
- *Student access*: Westmont College is committed to student success. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor privately or the Office of Disability Services (ODS) at ods@westmont.edu to coordinate course accommodations.
